Based on manual inspection of the files:

1. CURRENT GEOCODED DATA (apptegy-geocoded-current.json):
   - This file contains Apptegy competitor data with geocoded locations
   - Each record includes: recordId, name, competitor, domain, city, state, lat/lng coordinates
   - Records have additional fields like owner, createDate, products, customerType, etc.

2. BATCH GEOCODED DATA (apptegy-geocoded-batch.json):
   - Contains metadata showing:
     * Total results: 5,696 successful geocodes
     * Total errors: 7,042
     * Success rate: 44.72%
     * Processed at: 2025-07-16T04:59:37
   - Each successful geocode includes detailed location data from OpenStreetMap

3. MERGE PROCESS:
   - The merge_geocoded_data_v2.py script will:
     * Load both JSON files
     * Convert batch records to match current format
     * Add new records that don't already exist (based on recordId)
     * Create a backup of the current file
     * Save the merged data back to apptegy-geocoded-current.json

Due to shell issues, I cannot execute the merge script directly. 
Please try running these commands manually in your terminal:

cd /Users/aliarsan/edliocustomermap/
python3 merge_geocoded_data_v2.py

After the merge completes, you can check:
- File size: ls -lh apptegy-geocoded-current.json
- Git status: git status
- Record count: python3 -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('apptegy-geocoded-current.json'))))"
